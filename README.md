# Jenkins Config

This is an automatic backup of our Jenkins configuration using the
[SCM Sync configuration plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin).
To restore the backup, simply install the plugin on the Jenkins server if it
isn't already installed, and follow the instructions on the wiki.
